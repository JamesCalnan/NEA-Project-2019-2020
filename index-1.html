<p>contains almost every maze generation algorithm out there, also including a dungeon creation algorithm.
Has a lot of options when a maze is made, for example making the maze unicursal (a hamiltonian graph) which is useful.
Also contains a few path finding/graph traversal algorithms.
Contains about 20 sorting algorithms all of which are visualised (to a certain extent e.g. cycle, merge and pigeon sort i didn't know how to visualise in a good way and the sorting algorithms was kind of a side thing so i didn't put much effort into this.
Uses some windows forms features to output the mazes as a png image and the program can also read in png images (only ones that have been made using the program).</p>
<p>As it's written in vb the, poorly written, code should be pretty easy to interpret if you wanted to implement any of the listed algorithms below:</p>
