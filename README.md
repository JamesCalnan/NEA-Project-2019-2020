# NEA-Project-2019-2020
## written in vb.net
contains almost every maze generation algorithm out there, also including a dungeon creation algorithm.
Has a lot of options when a maze is made, for example making the maze unicursal (a hamiltonian graph) which is useful.
Also contains a few path finding/graph traversal algorithms.
Contains about 20 sorting algorithms all of which are visualised (to a certain extent e.g. cycle, merge and pigeon sort i didn't know how to visualise in a good way and the sorting algorithms was kind of a side thing so i didn't put much effort into this.
Uses some windows forms features to output the mazes as a png image and the program can also read in png images (only ones that have been made using the program).

As it's written in vb the, poorly written, code should be pretty easy to interpret if you wanted to implement any of the listed algorithms below:
